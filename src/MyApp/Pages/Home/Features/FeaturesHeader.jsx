        If you are just starting out to join the BIG boys. I recommend you start
        with the foundation (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) respectively, then walk
        your way up the ladder to an advanced section of the learning journey.
        However, if your confidence is touching the sky, hop on the ride and
        let's enter the realm of advance where all the fun is.
